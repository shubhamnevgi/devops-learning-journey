# üöÄ Day 22 Notes: Project Management & Your First Week as a DevOps Engineer

## What a DevOps Engineer Does in the First Week

When starting a new job, a DevOps engineer needs to quickly understand the organization's workflows beyond just technical skills. This is crucial for:

-   Devs transitioning to DevOps.
-   Freshers starting their first jobs.
-   Professionals switching careers.

Understanding **project management processes** and tools like Jira is key to fitting into ongoing teams and delivery cycles.

## Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Agile Overview üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Agile** is an iterative software development methodology that focuses on **continuous delivery** in short cycles called **Sprints**.

-   Instead of building a full feature over months (like the Waterfall model), Agile breaks work into smaller chunks for frequent delivery (weekly or bi-weekly).
-   This allows QA teams to validate parts earlier and provides faster feedback loops.
-   A foundational understanding of Agile is expected as it's used by ~90% of organizations today.

### 2. Jira: The Leading Project Management Tool for Agile üìã

**Jira** is a popular tool for managing Agile projects by organizing and tracking work items like **Epics**, **Stories**, **Tasks**, and **Bugs**.

**Common Jira usage:**
-   Managers/Leads monitor high-priority issues using Jira queries.
-   Scrum Masters plan Sprints and assign stories to team members.
-   Individual contributors track and update the status of their assigned tickets.

Jira provides clear visibility on what's been done, what's in progress, and what's planned. It's used for everything from basic ticket tracking to advanced workflows and reports.

### 3. How to Get Started with Jira üßë‚Äçüíª

-   Sign up for a free Jira trial.
-   Explore **Kanban** or **Scrum** boards and create dummy tickets.
-   Learn to perform basic queries using **Jira Query Language (JQL)** to find tickets by priority, assignee, or status.

Becoming comfortable with Jira helps you communicate effectively with your team and managers.

### 4. Additional Tools: Confluence & SharePoint for Documentation üìù

These are knowledge-sharing platforms used for storing internal documentation.

-   They enable teams to capture **runbooks**, **system designs**, and **deployment instructions**.
-   **Confluence** integrates well with Jira, which streamlines documentation and project tracking.

### 5. Role of ServiceNow in DevOps (Incidents and Changes) üö®

**ServiceNow** is often used for **Incident Management** and **Change Management** in large enterprises.

-   **Incident Management** is the process of handling production issues and alerts, which are created and routed to the responsible teams.
-   **Change Management** coordinates the formal process of approving and implementing changes to live systems (especially production).

Knowing these processes and the ServiceNow tool is vital for DevOps roles in service-driven environments.
