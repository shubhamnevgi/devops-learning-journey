# DevOps Interview Notes (Day 13: Top 15 AWS Services Every DevOps Engineer Should Learn) ☁️🛠️

### Q1: Why should a DevOps engineer focus on certain AWS services rather than all 200+ available? 🤔

**Answer:**
AWS offers over 200 services, but it is neither practical nor necessary for a DevOps engineer to learn everything. DevOps roles focus on **automation**, **efficiency**, and **security**, requiring strong understanding of foundational AWS services most commonly used in deployment, operations, monitoring, and scaling cloud infrastructure. 🚀🔒📊

### Q3: Give real-world scenarios/use-cases for key AWS services. 🎯

* **EC2:** Running web apps, backend jobs, test/stage/prod servers. 💻
* **S3:** Storing backups, static websites, log files, artifact sharing. 🗄️
* **IAM:** Creating least-privilege users (e.g., only deploy rights), rotating credentials. 🔑
* **CloudWatch:** Alerting when CPU is high, log events for debugging and tracing. 📈
* **Lambda:** Automating responses to infrastructure events (e.g., auto-remediation, notifications). 🤖
* **CodePipeline:** Automating build, test, and deploy steps for every git commit. 🚀
* **Billing/Cost Explorer:** Investigating monthly spikes, setting cost alarms. 💰

---

### Q4: Why is it important to know the differences between AWS container services: ECS vs. EKS? 📦

**Answer:**
* **ECS** is AWS’s native container service (proprietary, simpler for AWS-only workloads). 🛠️
* **EKS** is managed Kubernetes—important because Kubernetes is an open standard used across clouds, so learning EKS means you can transfer skills to other platforms (Azure, GCP, on-prem). 🌐
* **Fargate** allows running containers without managing EC2; ideal for serverless containers. ✨

---

### Q5: How do CloudWatch and Lambda work together in automation? 🤝🤖

**Answer:**
CloudWatch can trigger Lambda functions based on events or thresholds (e.g., unencrypted EBS volume detected), enabling auto-remediation, notifications, or custom workflow execution without manual intervention. 🔔🔄

---

### Q6: What is the practical importance of AWS Config, Billing/Cost Explorer, and KMS in enterprise DevOps? 🏢

* **AWS Config** ensures that resource state matches compliance and security rules, supporting governance. ⚖️
* **Billing/Cost Explorer** provides insights to prevent waste, accidental overprovisioning, or abandoned resources. 💸
* **KMS** lets you manage encryption keys and secure sensitive data—crucial for regulated industries or public companies. 🔐

### Q7: How can a fresher prioritize learning these services? 🎓

1.  Start with **EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and EBS** for foundational knowledge.
2.  Move to **CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy** for CI/CD pipelines. 🚀
3.  Add **CloudWatch, Lambda, and Config** for automation, monitoring, and compliance. 🤖
4.  Gradually learn **Kubernetes/EKS** and container orchestration as you advance. ☸️
5.  Study **billing, KMS, and CloudTrail** to understand security, governance, and cost efficiency. 💰🔒📜
