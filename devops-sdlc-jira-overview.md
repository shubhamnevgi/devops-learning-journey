## üìå Organizational Roles in DevOps: Essential Interview Q&A

### ‚ùì Q1: Who are the main roles involved in gathering and delivering requirements in an IT organization?

**Answer:**

- **Business Analyst (BA):** Interacts with customers to gather requirements and prepares the Business Requirement Document (BRD).
- **Product Manager (PM):** Sets product vision, prioritizes requirements, and coordinates with BA and Product Owner.
- **Product Owner (PO):** Breaks requirements into epics (major features/actionable items), manages the backlog, and interacts with Solution Architect.
- **Solution/Software Architect:** Designs the technical solution, prepares High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).
- **Development Team, DevOps Engineers, QA Engineers, Database Administrators, Technical Writers:** Implement and deliver the requirements within defined sprints as a "Scrum Team" or product team.

### ‚ùì Q2: As a DevOps engineer, do you interact directly with customers?

**Answer:**  
No, DevOps engineers typically receive requirements indirectly. The requirement flows from **customers ‚Üí BA ‚Üí PM ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Development team ‚Üí DevOps engineer**.

### ‚ùì Q3: What documents are crucial in the early stage of a project?

| **Role**             | **Document**                            | **Purpose**                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Business Analyst      | Business Requirement Document (BRD)     | Captures customer/market requirements         |
| Product Owner         | Epics, Stories (in Jira or similar PM tools) | Breakdown into actionable work          |
| Solution Architect    | HLD (High Level Design), LLD (Low Level Design) | System and module-level technical design |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Procedures: Jira and Scrum Workflows

### ‚ùì Q4: How does a DevOps engineer get day-to-day tasks assigned in a real organization?

**Step-by-step Practical Process:**

#### ‚úÖ Requirement Breakdown:
- PO creates epics (e.g., ‚Äú15-minute grocery delivery‚Äù).
- Epics are split into user stories (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate Kubernetes cluster‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuild payment gateway integration‚Äù).

#### ‚úÖ Jira Setup and Use:
- Organization and project are created in Jira.
- PO creates epics and stories on the Jira board.
- Work items (stories/tasks) are assigned to team members.

#### ‚úÖ Sprint Planning (Scrum Methodology):
- Team meets to select tasks from the backlog for the upcoming sprint (2 or 3 weeks).
- Each story is assigned to Developers, QA, or DevOps engineers as appropriate.

#### ‚úÖ Task Updates and Tracking:
- DevOps engineers regularly update the status and comments on their assigned Jira tasks (e.g., current progress, blockers).
- Team and management use Jira to view status, progress, and blockers across epics and stories.

#### ‚úÖ Backlog Refinement:
- New requirements continuously populate the backlog.
- If a DevOps engineer is overloaded, tasks remain in the backlog for future sprints.

### ‚ùì Q5: What is an "Epic" and how is it used in project tracking?

**Answer:**  
An **Epic** is a major requirement or feature in Jira, further divided into **user stories** (smaller tasks). Each Epic or story moves through workflow states:  
**To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done**

---

### ‚ùì Q6: What is the practical significance of using Jira for DevOps teams?

**Answer:**
- **Central visibility:** All requirements and progress are tracked in a single dashboard.
- **Responsibility:** Each task is assigned to a specific person, ensuring accountability.
- **Transparency:** Management and stakeholders can view updates and blockers in real-time.
- **Continuous improvement:** Sprint retrospectives at the end of each sprint review completed vs. pending items and adjust workflows.

---

### ‚ùì Q8: What is Backlog Refinement?

**Answer:**  
Ongoing process where **new stories and requirements are added**, prioritized, and assigned across sprints as DevOps or development resources become available.

---

### ‚ùì Q9: Why is practical experience with Jira valuable during interviews?

**Answer:**
- Demonstrates familiarity with real-world project management and team workflows.
- Shows your readiness to hit the ground running on collaborative tasks and status tracking.
