# DevOps Interview Notes (Day 5: AWS CLI, EC2 Connection Methods & Automation) 🚀

### Q1: What are the different ways to connect to an AWS EC2 instance? 🤝

**Answer:**

* **AWS Console UI:** 🌐
    * Connect directly via the web interface using the "Connect" button in the EC2 dashboard.

* **Terminal/SSH:** 💻
    * Use a terminal (like iTerm on Mac, MobaXterm or PuTTY on Windows) and the SSH command, along with the instance's public IP and key pair (`.pem` file).

---

### Q2: Why is using your local terminal/SSH preferred over the AWS Console for EC2 access? 🤔

* Automates and accelerates daily tasks. ⚡
* Allows scripting and efficient management of multiple connections. 📜
* Provides persistent sessions (Console UI session may timeout). ⏳
* Familiarity with SSH is a core DevOps expectation. ✅

---

### Q3: What is the process to connect to an EC2 instance using SSH from your laptop? 👨‍💻

**Step-by-step:**

1.  **Get the Public IP:** 📍
    * From EC2 dashboard, copy the public IP (not private, which is only accessible within AWS’s network).

2.  **SSH Command Format:** 🔑

    ```bash
    ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>
    ```
    * `-i`: Specifies the identity file (`.pem` key).
    * `ubuntu`: Default username for Ubuntu AMIs (can differ across OS).

3.  **File Permission:** 🔒
    * Ensure the `.pem` file is not publicly accessible:

    ```bash
    chmod 600 /path/to/key.pem
    ```
    * This is necessary for security reasons. 🛡️

4.  **Accept Fingerprint:** 👍
    * First-time connection will prompt to accept the server's fingerprint—type “yes.”

---

### Q4: What can go wrong when connecting via SSH, and how to fix it? ⚠️

* **Permission denied:** Usually due to incorrect key permissions (fix with `chmod 600 key.pem`).
* **Wrong username:** Use the correct username based on the OS ("ubuntu", "ec2-user", "admin", etc.). 👤
* **IP/Network/Security Group:** 🚦
    * Ensure port 22 (SSH) is open in the security group settings. 🔓

### Q5: What is AWS CLI and why is it important? 🖥️

**Answer:**
**AWS CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a tool to interact with AWS services from your local machine. It allows you to create, manage, and automate AWS resources (EC2, S3, etc.) efficiently. ⚙️

**Benefits:**

* **Automation:** Enables scripting of tasks (resource creation, management). 🤖
* **Consistency:** Same actions can be repeated reliably. ✨
* **Scale:** Useful for handling large numbers of resources. 📈

---

### Q6: How do you set up AWS CLI for use? 🛠️

**Steps:**

1.  **Download and Install:** ⬇️
    * On Windows: Download MSI installer from AWS CLI website.
    * On Mac/Linux: Use package managers or download binaries.

2.  **Verify Installation:** ✅

    ```bash
    aws --version
    ```

3.  **Configure AWS CLI:** 🔐

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```
    * Enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format (e.g., `json`).
    * Access keys are generated from AWS Console > Security Credentials. 🔑

### Q7: What are some basic AWS CLI commands relevant to a DevOps engineer? ➡️

* **List S3 buckets:** 🗑️

    ```bash
    aws s3 ls
    ```

* **Create a new S3 bucket:** ➕

    ```bash
    aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name
    ```

* **List EC2 instances:** 📋

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances
    ```

* **Create EC2 (reference):** 📝
    * Use documentation for `aws ec2 run-instances` command.

---

### Q8: Why is automating instance creation (EC2) preferred? 🚀

* Reduces manual errors, especially when deploying at scale. 📏
* Supports Infrastructure as Code practices. 🏗️
* Enables quick provisioning and deprovisioning as needed. ⏱️

---

### Q9: What are AWS CloudFormation Templates and what is their use? 📝☁️

**Answer:**
**CloudFormation Templates** are scripts (in YAML/JSON) designed to provision and manage AWS resources in a repeatable and automated manner. Used for Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**), they help manage complex cloud setups. 🏢

---

### Q10: How can you use Python to automate AWS tasks? 🐍

* Use the **`boto3` Python SDK** to interact programmatically with AWS. 👩‍💻
* Example: Listing running EC2 instances in a script.
* Benefits: Enables more complex logic and integrations beyond CLI scripts. 🧠

---

### Practical Procedures: Deleting/Managing EC2 Instances 🗑️

* **Stop Instance:** 🛑
    * Recommended to avoid unnecessary billing.
* **Terminate Instance:** 🔥
    * Destroys the instance and releases resources.
    * Always consider stopping before terminating.

---

### Q11: What is the recommended learning activity from this lesson? 🎓

* Install AWS CLI. ✅
* Configure CLI with your personal AWS credentials. ⚙️
* Practice using basic commands (`ls`, `mb`, `describe-instances`) on S3/EC2. 🚀
* Review AWS CLI documentation for further examples and practice tasks. 📖
