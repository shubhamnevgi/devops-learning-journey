# üìò DevOps Interview Notes (Day 2: SDLC and DevOps Integration)

### ‚ùì Q1: What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
**Answer:**  
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is the standard process followed in the software industry for designing, developing, and testing software. The goal of SDLC is to deliver high-quality products that meet or exceed customer expectations by following clear, structured stages.

### ‚ùì Q2: Why should every engineer, including DevOps engineers, understand SDLC?
**Answer:**  
- SDLC is universally applied across organizations, whether startups or large enterprises.
- Understanding SDLC ensures you can seamlessly work within teams, maintain standards, and contribute to building, testing, and deploying software efficiently.
- For DevOps engineers, it is especially critical because they focus on improving the efficiency of these processes across all stages.

### ‚ùì Q3: What are the main phases of SDLC?

| Phase      | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planning   | Gather and analyze requirements and define project goals.                   |
| Defining   | Clearly document all requirements (e.g., Software Requirement Specification). |
| Designing  | Prepare High Level Design (HLD) and Low Level Design (LLD) for the solution.|
| Building   | Developers write the code and push it to a central repository like Git.     |
| Testing    | Quality Assurance (QA) engineers test the software for defects or issues.   |
| Deployment | Application is promoted to production for customer use.                     |

### ‚ùì Q4: What is the main objective of following the SDLC?
**Answer:**  
The primary objective is to deliver a prompt, high-quality, thoroughly-tested product that meets customer requirements and is reliable in production.

---

### ‚ùì Q5: Where do DevOps engineers fit into the SDLC?
**Answer:**  
DevOps engineers mainly focus on automating the building, testing, and deployment phases of SDLC. Their goal is to:

- Make processes faster by minimizing manual intervention.
- Ensure code is quickly and reliably built, tested, and deployed.
- Increase organizational efficiency through best practices and toolchains.

---

### ‚ùì Q6: In an interview, if you're asked where DevOps adds the most value in SDLC, what should you answer?
**Answer:**  
> "As a DevOps engineer, my primary focus is on automating the building, testing, and deployment phases of the SDLC. By automating these core steps, I can help streamline software delivery, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency, ensuring high-quality releases reach customers faster."

---

### ‚ùì Q7: Why is automation so important in DevOps?
**Answer:**  
Automation:

- Increases efficiency.
- Reduces errors associated with manual work.
- Accelerates software delivery and feedback cycles.
- Is directly proportional to improved product delivery and organizational agility.

---

### ‚ùì Q8: What document is typically created during the 'Defining' stage of SDLC, and what does it contain?
**Answer:**  
The 'Defining' stage involves creating a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document. This document includes:

- All requirements and features planned for the product.
- Data gathered from customer feedback and business needs.
- Technical and functional expectations for the software.

---

### ‚ùì Q9: What is the difference between High Level Design (HLD) and Low Level Design (LLD) in SDLC?

| Aspect     | High Level Design (HLD)                     | Low Level Design (LLD)                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Scope      | System architecture, scalability, availability | Module-level details, functions, specific logic |
| Created By | Architects, senior technical leads           | Senior developers, module leads             |
| Examples   | Database choices, replication strategy       | API definitions, function logic, class structure |

---

### ‚ùì Q10: SDLC models, and which is widely adopted in modern software delivery?
**Answer:**  

- **Waterfall Model**
- **Iterative Model**
- **Agile Model** (widely adopted in modern organizations due to its flexibility, fast feedback loops, and iterative delivery approach)
